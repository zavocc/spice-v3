remote displays and devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, audio). The main
use case is to get remote access to virtual machines, although other
use cases are possible and in various development stage.</p><p>Spice provides a desktop-like user experience, while trying to offload
most of the intensive CPU and GPU tasks to the client. The basic
building blocks of Spice are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

and features, obtaining, building installing and using Spice.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_spice_and_spice_related_components"></a>1.1. Spice and Spice-related components</h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="spice-server"></a>Spice Server</h4></div></div></div><p>Spice server is implemented in libspice, a VDI pluggable
library. Currently, the main user of this library is QEMU. QEMU uses
spice-server to provide remote access to virtual machines through the
Spice protocol. Virtual Device Interface (VDI) defines a set of
interfaces that provide a standard way to publish virtual devices
(e.g. display device, keyboard, mouse) and enables different Spice
components to interact with those devices. On one side, the server
communicates with the remote client using the Spice protocol and on
the other side, it interacts with the VDI host application (e.g QEMU).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="spice-client"></a>Spice Client</h4></div></div></div><p>The Spice client is a program which is used by the end user to access
remote systems through Spice. The recommended client is remote-viewer
(which is shipped with virt-viewer). GNOME Boxes can also be used as a
Spice client. spicec is an obsolete legacy client, and spicy is only a
test application.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_qxl_device_and_drivers"></a>QXL Device and Drivers</h4></div></div></div><p>Spice server supports the QXL VDI interface. When libspice is used
with QEMU, a specific video PCI device can be used for improving
remote display performance and enhancing the graphic capabilities of
the guest graphic system. This video device is called a QXL device and
requires guest QXL drivers for full functionality. However, standard
VGA is supported when no driver exists.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_spice_agent"></a>Spice Agent</h4></div></div></div><p>The Spice agent is an optional component for enhancing user experience
and performing guest-oriented management tasks. For example, the agent
injects mouse position and state to the guest when using client mouse
mode. It also enables you to move cursor freely between guest and
client. Other features of agent are shared clipboard (copy and paste
between guest and host) and aligning guest resolution with client when
entering fullscreen mode.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_vdi_port_device"></a>VDI Port Device</h4></div></div></div><p>The Spice protocol supports a communication channel between the client
and the agent on the server side. When using QEMU, Spice agent resides
on the guest. VDI port is a QEMU PCI device used for communication
with the agent.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="spice-protocol"></a>Spice Protocol</h4></div></div></div><p>The Spice protocol defines the messages and rules for the
communication between the various Spice components.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_features"></a>1.2. Features</h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_multiple_channels"></a>Multiple Channels</h4></div></div></div><p>The server and client communicate via channels. Each channel is
dedicated to a specific type of data. The available channels are the
following:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">

on server initiation and dynamically at run-time. Quic is a Spice
proprietary image compression technology based on the SFALIC
algorithm. The Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithm is another option. Both Quic
and LZ are local algorithms encoding each image separately. Global LZ
(GLZ) is another proprietary Spice technology that uses LZ with
history-based global dictionary. GLZ takes advantage of repeating
patterns among images to shrink the traffic and save bandwidth, which
is critical in a WAN environment. Spice also offers an automatic mode
for compression selection per image, where the choice between LZ/GLZ
and Quic is heuristically based on image properties. Conceptually,
synthetic images are better compressed with LZ/GLZ and real images are
better with Quic.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_video_compression"></a>Video Compression</h4></div></div></div><p>Spice uses loss-less compression for images sent to the
client. However, video streams are handled differently. Spice server
heuristically identifies video areas and sends them as a video stream
coded using M-JPEG. This handling saves a lot of traffic, improving
Spice performance, especially in a WAN environment. However, in some
circumstances the heuristic behavior might cause low quality images
(e.g. identifying updated text area as a video stream). Video
streaming can be chosen on server initiation and dynamically at
run-time.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_mouse_modes"></a>Mouse modes</h4></div></div></div><p>Spice supports two mouse modes: server and client. The mode can be
changed dynamically and is negotiated between the client and the
server.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
Server mouse
</span></dt><dd>
When a user clicks inside the Spice client window, the client mouse is
captured and set invisible. In this mode, the server controls the
mouse position on display. However, it might be problematic on WAN or
on a loaded server, where mouse cursor might have some latency or
non-responsiveness.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Client mouse
</span></dt><dd>
Not captured and is used as the effective pointing device. To enable
client mouse, the VDI host application must register an absolute
pointing device (e.g. USB tablet in QEMU). This mode is appropriate
for WAN or for a loaded server, since cursor has smooth motion and
responsiveness. However, the cursor might lose synchronization
(position and shape) for a while.
