What is here
============

This directory will contain a testsuite for the server.

You can run all the tests and use libtool to debug any of them:

libtool --mode=execute gdb test-just-sockets-no-ssl

Overview of tests
=================

test-just-sockets-no-ssl
 A complete server, only provides the main and inputs channels. Doesn't actually produce anything on the channels. Essentially a test of the regular link code (reds.c), good for multiple connect/disconnect tests.

test-empty-success
 tests calling

test-fail-on-null-core-interface
 should abort when run (when spice tries to watch_add)

basic-event-loop.c
 event loop to provide core interface.

Automated tests
===============

test-display-streaming.c
 this test can be used to check regressions. For this, test-display-streaming needs to be called passing --automated-tests as parameter
